Final: Question 20
(* ****** ****** *)
This question is worth 10 points.
(* ****** ****** *)
Given two integer lists xs and ys, please implement
list_prefix(xs, ys) which tests whether xs is a prefix of ys.
Note that [] is a prefix of any list. Your implementation
cannot use explicit recursion. It can only use list_length,
list_head (head of a given list), and list_tail (tail of a given list)
in addition to list_foldleft and/or list_foldright. (Yes, pattern
matching is allowed).

val list_prefix = ...
